# The Long Tail
This is a human computation game based on the CARLA scenario runner. Please follow the carla scenario runner main repository to follow the installation instructions. Once everything is set up, please be informed that scenario_runner.py script is hard coded to run route scenarios specifically on the Town02 map in CARLA. 

To run The Long Tail scenario editor please run TheLongTail.py while the CARLA unreal project is in play mode. For now, you can set up the spawn point of one NPC vehicle and have scenario runner run with that data just by running scenario_runner.py
